This is a web. Anything can connect to anything.
If x is in y's list, y is in x's list,
but they can be different orders (try by priority or time).

Left click goes into a name
Right click backs out of a name
Left and right click together selects a name
Drag any name in or drag to reorder (useful if ordered highest priority closer to middle of window)

The + button adds a name, and - removes it.

You can search by parts of words like "ord sea" finds names containing both "search" and "words"

No save button. All changes are automaticly saved every 1 minute
and copied to version history every 15 minutes, when changes exist.
To get those versions, like if you delete or change by accident,
they're the .jsonperline files in "+Root.jsonVarDir
The .json files are smaller and easier to read and are the newest of each name.

Listweb is opensource GNU GPL 2+
To get the source code, unzip this jar file which you doubleclicked.
